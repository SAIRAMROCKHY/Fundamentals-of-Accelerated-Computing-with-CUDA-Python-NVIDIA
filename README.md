# GPU-Accelerated Python with CUDA and Numba Workshop

Welcome to the GPU-Accelerated Python with CUDA and Numba Workshop repository! This workshop focuses on teaching fundamental tools and techniques to accelerate Python applications using CUDA GPUs and the Numba compiler.

## About this Workshop

This workshop introduces participants to GPU-accelerated Python programming using CUDA and Numba. You'll learn to accelerate NumPy operations, write custom CUDA kernels, optimize memory transfers, and utilize shared memory for improved performance.

### Learning Objectives

By the end of this workshop, participants will:
- GPU-accelerate NumPy universal functions (ufuncs) with Numba.
- Configure CUDA thread hierarchy for efficient parallelization.
- Write custom CUDA kernels for maximum performance and flexibility.
- Optimize CUDA kernel performance using memory coalescing and shared memory.
